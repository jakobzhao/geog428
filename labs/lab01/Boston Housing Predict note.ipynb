    "\n",
    "This lab guides you through a critical exploration of housing data using statistical modeling and machine learning. Drawing on real-world data from the **Boston Housing dataset**, this project walks you through how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read and preprocess structured real estate data  \n",
    "- Visualize key features such as room count, location, and pollution levels  \n",
    "- Build and evaluate predictive models  \n",
    "- Reflect on what factors most significantly impact housing prices  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is not only to build a predictive model, but to **understand what the model tells us‚Äîand fails to tell us‚Äîabout urban inequality**.\n"

    "- Load and clean the Boston Housing dataset using `pandas`  \n",
    "- Visualize relationships between features using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  \n",
    "- Fit and evaluate models (e.g., Linear Regression)  \n",
